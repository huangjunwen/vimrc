# vimrc

My vim configuration, mainly used in Golang development.

# Requirement

- Golang 1.8+ installed and env setup: `$PATH` and `$GOPATH`

- If using neovim, python3 is needed.

# Install

1. Clone this repo to some path `/path/to/this/repo`
2. Make a symlink: `~/.vim` -> `/path/to/this/repo`; Make sure you backup your original `.vim` and `.vimrc`
3. Open a vim and run `:PlugInstall` to install plugins and tools used by plugins
